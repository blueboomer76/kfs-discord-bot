# KFS Discord Bot

A multipurpose Discord bot for fun, utility, and more, written in discord.js.

## Description

This is an **actively developed bot** that not only has fun, moderation, utility commands, but also a phone command for calling other servers, and combines features from popular bots.

## How to Install

*Note: You need to have Node.js 8 or newer installed before you can start the bot, and it is recommended to have a 64-bit operating system when running it*

1. Install a program that can clone GitHub repositories, such as Git Bash for Windows
2. Run `git clone` with this repository's clone URL
3. Open Command Prompt (Windows), Terminal (Mac), or other program and run `cd ../path/to/directory` or similar if necessary to move the directory to the kfs-discord-bot repository.
4. Rename the file `config.example.json` to `config.json` and replace everything in brackets (`<`, `>`, `[`, or `]`) with the correct values. Required values (with `<` and `>`) are needed for the bot to work, and optional values (with `[` and `]`) can use `null` in place of the value.
5. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
6. Run `node index.js`

You can update the bot by running `git pull` to get the latest features.
